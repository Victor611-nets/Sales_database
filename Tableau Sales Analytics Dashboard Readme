Sales Analytics: Trends, Rankings & Growth

An interactive Tableau dashboard designed to uncover sales performance patterns, top-performing products, regional strength, and growth trends using a cleaned sales dataset.

This project focuses on clear business storytelling, combining structured data preparation with compelling visual analytics.

🧠 Project Objective

The goal of this dashboard is to answer key business questions:

How is revenue trending over time?

Which countries and products generate the most sales?

Who are the top-performing salespeople?

Where is growth accelerating or slowing down?

The dashboard is built to support data-driven decision-making for sales and business stakeholders.
